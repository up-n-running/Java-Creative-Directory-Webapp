samplewords = The origins of Halloween date back over 2000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sowin).This festival which means the end of summer celebrated the end of harvest and the beginning of the Celtic new year on November 1st.Return of the deadWhen the cold and dark winter nights drew in people's thoughts often turned to death.The Celts believed that on the night before the new year the boundary between this world and the world of the dead dissolved and the dead returned to earth causing trouble and damaging crops.It wasn't all bad though since the Celts thought that the presence of these spirits helped their priests to make predictions about the future. These forecasts and warnings about the future were an important source of solace during the long dark winter.Sacred bonfires			Sacred bonfire 	To celebrate Samhain the Druids built huge sacred bonfires. People came together to burn crops and animals as sacrifices to the Celtic gods.During the celebration the Celts wore costumes usually animal heads and skins. They would also try and tell each other's fortunes.After the festival they relit the fires in their homes from the sacred bonfire to help protect them as well as keep them warm during the winter months.Enter the RomansBy 43 CE the Roman Empire had conquered most of the Celtic regions.In the following 400 years two Roman festivals became incorporated with Samhain. The first was Feralia a day in late October when the Romans commemorated the passing of the dead and the second was a day to honour Pomona the Roman goddess of fruit and trees An apple is the symbol of Pomona so perhaps this is the origin of the tradition of bobbing for apples: whoever bit into an apple first would be married first the next yearSpectacular fireworks and bonfires organised by Leeds City Council will take place across the city brightening the city’s skies on Friday 5 November 2004. The bonfire and fireworks displays are expected to attract more than 60000 people from all over the region.""The traditional bonfires and fireworks displays are a great evening of safe family entertainment.

Marathons listed in alphabetical order. marathon walking . comWe have just started this review section and we need your help. Please submit your marathon reviews. Provide any information that will assist walkers in determining if a particular marathon is suitable for them.Blue Angel Half MarathonPensacola Floridaby Vicki Florida Feb 2001The half marathon is run in conjunction with the Blue Angel Marathon at Naval Air Station Pensacola. They both start at 0700. The course for the half marathon is entirely on base and is fairly flat. It goes past Barrancas National Cemetery the National Museum of Naval Aviation along water and beach and by various Naval schools and airplanes. The half marathon and marathon splits at just past mile 10 with the half marathon heading back to the joint finish line. There is an associated expo in the base gym. No registration on the day of the event but you can pick up race packets that morning.This event was added in 2001 and there are no finisher medals (currently). The first year the tshirt was the same as the marathon. This year it was a short sleeved version of the marathon shirt. All marathon and half marathon runners receive a goody bag which has included a cup/mug and a race poster. I did this race in 2001 (the "inaugural" year). My estimate of the time limit is based on the fact that the clock runs for the marathon for at least 6 hours and the marathon and half both finish at the same clock. The roads during the first 56 miles are steeply graded but with very little traffic so the runners/walkers can use most of the road to find flatter spots. The water stations are about 3 miles apart and are well stocked and manned for about 5.5 hours. While I wouldn't necessarily rate the marathon as walker friendly the half marathon definitely is.Casino Niagara Marathon and Half MarathonOntario Canada (Buffalo NY)by Barbara Akron Ohio 2002I completed the half marathon last year. I actually ran it. But this is a fantastic course to walk. It is so pretty. You run/walk along the niagara parkway Niagara Falls Ontario. And it is flat straight course. Easier one for beginners even though it does get quite chilly and windy in late Oct. It was very scenic running along the river the whole way and finish line is at Niagara Falls. Pretty in the fall season and have falls and mist in distance. And it is a big motivation to get to finish line. They did a great job for entry fee. And many groups serve as cheerleaders and there is a lot of support before during and after race. They have an international breakfast run/jog/walk on Sat morning before race and it was fun and met alot of runners/walkers from other countries. They also had a sponsor who provided water juice bagels coffee fruit ect for that mornings breakfast.They have an official walk division for half marathon this year (2003). And had a walk div for full marathon last year. this would be a great one to participate in! Whether you walk or run it!Des Moines Inaugaral MarathonDes Moines Iowaby Lee St Louis MO October 2002Despite the fact that this was their first it ranked among the top 3 marathons that I have ever done. Good points: The course was very scenic part city part park and part residential. It was marked great. Loads of volunteers. Plenty of water stops and several snack stops on the course. The spectators were fabulous passing out candy water cheers music etc. Most that I have ever seen.This marathon was very inspiring. There were two blind male runners who completed it (the one that I saw was tethered to a person on a bike who told them what to do). There was a one legged man who ran it (the artificial limb that contacted the ground had the appearance of a 1" X 2" piece of wood). The weather was great even though the prediction was for lousy weather (rain & high winds). There were plenty of snacks at the finish line. Walkers were treated great. We were allowed up to 1.5 hour early start and could start any time we wanted. The water stops were manned and volunteers were out to point out the route. Nice medal. I finished it.....and feel good.Negative points: Never enough port of pots. Most water stops had only one. Even though they had chip timing they did not have a mat at the start line to get an accurate start time. The half marathoners were limited on water/snacks at the finish line.I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS MARATHON.Fairfield Trail RunsFairfield IAby Ollie Peoria IL August 2002I did this in 2002 (walking)The location: Jefferson State Park just 1 mile southeast of Fairfield Iowa.The events: half marathon marathon 50K.The course: several loops within the state park. Basically you do 3 loops for the half 6 for the marathon and 7 for the 50K. There is no time limit.The trail is very walkable. There are some small hills and one really good hill but no "singletrack" per se; there is room for people to go sidebyside and still have someone pass throughout the course. The trails have very few roots; there is mostly small gravel grass and a tiny bit of asphalt.There are two aid stations per loop; carrying a water bottle is a good idea.The race is usually held the last Sunday in August. It can get hot but there is some shade. The race and the support staff is small and the atmosphere is very friendly. Information on the race can be found from sites such as www.ultrarunner.net or the Des Moines Runner's club.Fox Cities MarathonAppleton WIby Beth September 2002The weather was great and the course was very nice lots of flat wide road and passed through a lot of parks (there were however a few icky hills including one that was neverending at mile 14 and a very ugly overpass at the mile 24 mark). The volunteers were very enthusiastic and there were plenty of water stops. All the intersections were well controlled.They did a good job of keeping the course and finishing area open until the last person came in and had plenty of medals as well. There were about 650 people doing the full marathon including about 70 who had signed up as walkers. The race number bib also had each person's name printed on it fairly large and all the volunteers had been encouraged to call people by name instead of just generic cheering which was kind of cool but also a little weird. Lastly I can happily say that I finished with a new PR.Humpy's MarathonAnchorage AKby Jaye St. Louis MO Aug 2002On Aug 18 I participated in the annual "running" of Humpy's marathon in Anchorage AK. It is so named by the presenting sponsor Humpy's Great Alaskan Ale House. Later I found out that Humpy is a nickname for the pink salmon.There was an early start for walkers which was easily accomplished as they introduced Champion Chip timing this year. The race director expected only a dozen or so walkers and was surprised to find over 50 of us starting early.The course was composed of three separate outandback loops the second and third were coastal courses run on bike paths. The course was almost exclusively asphalt with the exception of about .1 mile on dirt at the start and about 0.2 mi of course gravel at the finish. Overall the course was flat with some change in elevations (undulations) to make it interesting and two little hills that we encountered on the way out and again on the way back. The weather in Anchorage could not have been more perfect. It was a chilly 50 degree start sunshine and cool weather throughout.Water stops were about every two miles often staffed by high school track team members who were pretty unhelpful not really understanding that it would be nice to hand cups of water to runners/walkers.Overall I give this race an A. It was wellorganized small and very friendly. The race admission price included a carbload dinner the evening before and a postrace pasta feed after. I didn't stay for the pasta party and award ceremony afterwards so I don't know how that went but there were plenty of cookies bananas oranges and bagels at the finish line. The scenery was breathtaking with views of Cook's Inlet and coniferous/deciduous forests. The outandback course gave ample opportunity to see who was ahead and behind and a chance to be encouraged and give encouragement.My criticisms are modest: aid station workers should have been better educated and the course got clogged after the marathon runners halfmarathoners started and they ran and walked 34 abreast while I was coming back. It would have been nice to have a walking division and there were certainly enough walkers to make it possible but of course it would have had to be "on the honor system" (harumph.)Otherwise it was a great venue and a great time and a great place for a PR. I love Alaska and so did my family. Put this one on your "to do" list.Maui MarathonMaui Hawaiiby Angela Texas March 2001Very smalltownish feel about 3000 people. Not very many walkers but still nice support; some fairly long stretches walking alone (with the beautiful scenery who cares?!). I think the time limit was 6+ hours. I saw people crossing the finish for a long time and still being announced over the loud speakers. Free massages at the end! Very early start to catch the cool weather but still finished with temps in the 80's. Although hillier than Dallas nothing outlandish. I went there in March 2001 with Team in Training. The downside now is they've changed the dates to September. In March the whales were there and accompanied us along the way!Motorola MarathonAustin Texasby Jana Houston February 2002This was my first marathon and I couldn't have chosen a better place to do it. There is an 8 hour time limit and every mile had Gatorade water and a porta pot. What more could you ask for. Even till the bitter end there were crowds cheering all along the way. It was in the high 40's at the start and mid 60's I think at the finish. Considering it took me 7 hours and 17 min. it was mid afternoon by the time I finished. The support was great and the worst hill was downtown Austin going up Congress (or something like that). If I hadn't had severe blisters by the finish this would have been the perfect day. It was great and I'm already signed up to do it again in 2003.Portland MarathonPortland Oregonby PC Texas Oct 2000Lots of walkers of all levels. Walker awards. Good course support. They could have had a few more rest rooms early on to keep lines down and they did run out of cups at one of the aid stations other than that there was very good course support. Slower walkers are moved to an alternate route at the end of the course. I beat the cut off but have been told by others that this is where the best support is. The finish line stays open 8 hours.We had quite a bit of rain early on in the race but we had great temperatures. There was pretty good crowd support and many bands/musicians to liven up the course. The course begins and ends in a small park area. It is an easy course with only a few small hills. There are many hotels within a short walking distance. We stayed at the host hotel and they were very friendly/helpful. I loved the Portland area and would definitely do this marathon again.Portland MarathonPortland Oregonby Karen Oregon October 2002Weather: mid 60's F overcast light breeze. In other words perfect.Course: fairly flat two short steep hills (about mile 2 and mile 17) one looooong downhill about mile 23.Volunteers/aid stations: excellent as always in Portland. Lines for the portapotties throughout however so maybe they should add a few more.Snacks: I was too slow to get the gummibears at mile 10 but there were Clif bars at mile 14 and bananas at mile 18. Wide assortment of yummy things at the end including Dreyers icecream. (Funny how EVERYTHING looked yummy there at the end.....)Fellow walkers: Lots and lots of walkers no special start and they keep the course open for at least 8 hours. I spent most of the race within shouting distance of Admiral John Besson age 90. He blew past a bunch of walkers at mile 23 and finished around 6:48 a US record for his age group.Me: My second marathon (both in Portland). I went out expecting to finish in 7:15 but surprised myself and finished at 6:50. Kept a steady pace (about 15:35/mile) throughout.My questions: how soon can I do another? What sort of training should I do so I can go faster?Rock N' Roll Half MarathonVirginia Beach VAby Vicki Catonment FL September 2001 and 2002The inaugural RNR Half was held in 2001. I guess you could call it the younger sibling of the RNR Marathon in San Diego which enjoys a reputation as being very walkerfriendly. This race is no different. The time limit is a generous (four hours) and there are many LeukemiaLymphoma Team in Training folks as well as many racewalkers who completed this race in 2001 and 2002.A point to point course it has few hills/inclines and great course support. Cheerleader teams compete for prizes so they are quite enthusiastic for every runner/walker. The bands are the best (in my opinion) of the three Elite Racing events (RNR Marathon Country Music Marathon/Half Marathon and RNR Half). In 2002 despite inclement weather the bands were out there providing great music and inspiration to all participants. Water stops are well stocked and well manned. The finish along the boardwalk of Virginia Beach gives one a great view of the Atlantic ocean and folks lean out of waterfront hotels and condos to cheer the runners/walkers. A large screen lets you see yourself as you approach the finish. Elvis sightings at the finish area are numerous as well as other musical stars.San Diego Rock n' Roll MarathonSan Diego CAAngela Texas June 2002So many people!!! That was quite exciting. I went with TNT as did more than 6000 other participants so there were quite a lot of walkers and a nice time limit (7 hours I think). The music was fun and the terrain was fairly flat with just a couple short steep hills. Support was good all the way and there were always lots of people around you walking/running. Could of used a few more porta pottys but much better than Dallas.White Rock MarathonDallas TXby MarieClaire Dallas Dec 20012002 saw a great day weatherwise High 30's when we started but mid 60's by the time we finished all under glorious blue skies. We did not have access to the American Airlines Center facilities but it looks like we will in 2003 no more portopotties outside!! The support along the route was outstanding: at least every 2 miles if not more water and gatorade early on snacks of fruit peanut butter cookies nuts and similar items after mile 10 or so. Not enough portopotties up to mile 8... the common curse of such events! Long lines at each one... I know that this year I will time my water intake in order not to have to use them until much later!! But no problems later on once all the runners are gone and the only ones left are us walkers! The terrain is much flatter than the topo map seems to indicate. The "hill" at the beginning as we leave downtown and go up Armstrong is nothing to write home about and there are a couple of steeper hills but blissfully short as we get out of the lake area at about mile 22 or so.White Rock MarathonDallas Texasby Angela Texas Dec 2001I ditto Marie Claire. I did it December 2001 and just found that portapottys were lacking. Only drawback is I'm not sure how "walker friendly" the current decision making group for this race is.IntroductionThe two main reasons I created this translation were: 1) to make a more accurate English translation of the Bible and 2) to make it free. God gave his Holy Scriptures freely and he intended for them to always be free. Certainly publishers have the right to sell what they print and translators have a right to be paid for their labor but the words themselves represent (or claim to represent) the Word of God and it is robbery to copyright them. Hence my translation is now and for all time placed in the public domain.The text is available in two formats: 1) the traditional KJV style of verse grouping and 2) the modern style of paragraph grouping. Please note that there are four verses that are contained in some New Testament translations (including the KJV and the ASV) that I excluded because they are not found in the majority of the Greek manuscripts. They are Luke 17:36 Acts 8:37 Acts 15:34 and Acts 24:7.The Old TestamentRegarding the text of the Old Testament I began with the American Standard Version (no longer under copyright) then I mostly made minor word changes in order to make it more readable for our generation. In some cases I also utilized the texts of the KJV and Young's Literal translation. There were a few places where I was dissatisfied with all of those translations. In those cases I utilized the texts of the Masoretic Hebrew the Septuagint Greek (LXX) and a translation of the Hebrew of the Dead Sea scrolls. The Masoretic text is the Bible some Jewish scholars compiled sometime six to ten centuries after Christ. The Septuagint is a Greek translation of the Old Testament created by Jews about two centuries before Christ. (The Septuagint is what was used by the authors of the New Testament when they quoted the Old Testament.) The texts of the Dead Sea scrolls are dated variously from several centuries before Christ to about his time.Virtually all English translations of the Old Testament (including the KJV and the ASV) primarily if not exclusively have come from the Masoretic Hebrew text. However since those Masoretic Jews who compiled that edition from the manuscripts available to them were enemies of Christ then I treat that text with some degree of suspicion especially since I have read the words of at least one of the ancient Christian patriarchs that accused the Jews of falsifying a few passages of it. Nevertheless except for some Old Testament passages that were quoted in the New Testament plus one verse taken from the Dead Sea scrolls I did not deviate from the general wording of the ASV (or the other translations I borrowed from).There are several hundred verses from the Old Testament that are quoted in the New Testament. Since the authors of the New Testament quoted primarily from the Greek Septuagint translation then for most of those Old Testament passages I had three sources of the text available: the Masoretic Hebrew the Greek Septuagint and the Greek New Testament. (For some passages the text was also available from the Dead Sea scrolls.) In most cases the three texts did not differ significantly. When they did however I gave the New Testament and the Septuagint priority over the Masoretic. On those few cases where they all differed I gave priority to the New Testament since who knows better what the original words were than the Holy Spirit that guided the hands of the men who wrote the New Testament. Yet I tried to be very conservative in making those few changes. When the words were mostly similar and the sense was the same I kept the words translated from the Masoretic text. The changes I did make ranged from a single word to several verses.Out of about 23000 verses in the Old Testament I substituted words from the Septuagint in 38 of them and words from the New Testament in 21 of them. In every case I made what I did known by enclosing those words in curly brackets. Also I indicated the source by the symbols LXX and NT. In no case did I substitute words from the Septuagint that were not generally the same as those in the New Testament. Therefore when you see the words in curly brackets with the symbol LXX that means the wording of both the Septuagint and the New Testament generally agree. Wwhen you see the symbol NT that means that the words of both the Masoretic text and the Septuagint were somewhat different from those of the New Testament.There are too many complex issues involved in finding the original words to describe here. My goal in making these few changes in the Old Testament translation was to improve the unity of the words of our Bibles. Dear reader I am a believer not a scoffer. The vast majority of undisputed words in the Bible are more than adequate to prove to anybody (who loves truth) of its divine nature. Upon that foundation of faith I strive to make the words we have as accurate as I can. And revealing its original unity is one part of that.Now regarding God's name. The ancient Hebrew language contains no vowels only consonants and the word for God's name that is used in the books of the Hebrew Old Testament consists of the four consonant letters YHWH (transliterated) and knowledge of its correct pronunciation was lost many centuries ago. Nineteenth Century German theologians suggested using the word "Yahweh" which is presently fashionable in the theological world. The translators of the ASV chose the word "Jehovah." But since the Godspirited authors of the New Testament used the Septuagint when quoting from the Old Testament they used the Greek word for "lord." Perhaps that is why the translators of the KJV used that word. However the word "lord" is used as both an adjective and a proper noun in the Bible and they chose to use the adjective form capitalizing all of its letters and adding the article thus producing "the LORD." However when faced with both the adjective and the noun together they wrote "Lord GOD" instead of "lord the LORD" for obvious reasons. Now I chose to follow their example in using the capitalized word "lord" but I used it as a proper noun because it represents God's name. So when both the adjective and the noun are together I wrote it "lord LORD" or "the Lord LORD."The New TestamentBy far most of the three years I spent translating was with the New Testament because although I began revising the New Testament text of the ASV I ended up translating almost all of it directly from the Greek itself. And I did not use the same Greek edition that was used by the translators of the ASV because I consider that edition to be based upon inferior manuscripts. Since there are currently over 5000 surviving manuscripts of the New Testament books and they do not all agree completely scholars of Bible Greek must necessarily pick and choose in order to create a usable Greek New Testament. The edition I chose was compiled by Maurice A. Robinson and William G. Pierpont (of the Textus Receptus tradition). To see the reasons for my choice of that text read the essay Searching for the Word of God.In addition to using many books I relied very heavily upon the computer program BibleWorks. I also relied very much on Maurice Robinson's material that contains the Greek text plus grammar aids. I found this material so helpful that I decided to integrate the words of my English translation with that information to make available a study Bible of the New Testament for those of you who want to examine the Greek text without having to become skilled with that language. You can find out more about that by reading the introduction to the New Testament GreekEnglish Study Bible. You can also compare the wording of my translation with the Greek text in that study Bible. For that reason I did not bracket or italicize words that were only inferred by the Greek. Not every translation does so and most of those that do are not consistent about it including the KJV and the ASV. Nevertheless all English translations must occasionally add such inferred words. For example there are many sentences in the Greek New Testament that have no verb. In such cases the word "is" is most commonly added. I did my best to keep the number of such additions minimal. Nevertheless if there is any question in your mind the GreekEnglish Study Bible will make clear when such things were or were not done.I also employed the old pronouns (thee thy etc) because they provide more information than the often ambiguous word "you." The words "thee" "thou" "thy" and "thine" are all singular pronouns. The words "you" "ye" and "your" are plural. A good rule of thumb to use while learning these words is that if the word begins with the letter "t" it is singular. Here is some other information they contain that the modern "you" does not. "Thee" is in the objective case while "thou" is nominative. "Thy" and "thine" are possessive. "Thine" is used in place of "thy" before a word that begins with a vowel or an unaspirated "h"; for example "for thine is the kingdom" or "thine heir." "Ye" is nominative and plural while "you" is in the objective case equivalent to "thee" but always plural in the old English. "Your" is also possessive but always plural in the old English.I have wondered why our language has been weakened by forsaking these more informative words. Is it because the enemies of Christ want to discard and discredit everything that reminds us of our Christian heritage like the wording of the KJV Bible? Language is often manipulated in order to manipulate thinking either for good or for evil. It is naive to deny Satan's continuous active hostility. When speaking of dates modern scholars have substituted the expressions BCE (before the common era) and CE (common era) for BC and AD so as to remove any reference to Christ our Lord. Did you know that the ancient Egyptians were so successful in destroying any record of the Israelites ever being in Egypt that the only way we know they were there is from the Bible?Translating the Greek New Testament into English basically involves two things: 1) selecting equivalent words and 2) arranging them in correct order. Perhaps the greatest strength of the English language is the size of its vocabulary. Nevertheless there are many Greek words that do not have an exact English equivalent. I chose the best I could depending upon the context. But only by carefully studying the lexicons and examining how each word is used by the New Testament authors can you learn their meaning more fully. Every translation has this limitation.Also I discarded a few common English words used in virtually all translations. I did this for greater accuracy. For example I used the word "agent" instead of the transliterated "angel." There is so much that is false and perverted associated with the word "angel" that its use only promotes error. I also translated the actual meaning of many words normally transliterated. For example the word "baptism" literally means "immersion" and so that is how I translated it. I also translated several other words different from other translators for the same reason: for greater accuracy. Consequently some familiar passages may seem strange to you. If this happens I beseech you to reconsider your previous understanding and be like the brothers in Berea: 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 			Free Downloads...The Greek New Testament according to the Byzantine Text form. 2000 Revision.Edited by Maurice A.

Robinson 2 May 2000The codes which follow reflect an original abridgment and correction of the parsing data presented in Samuel Davidson "The Analytical Greek Lexicon" (London: Samuel Bagster and Sons 1859) which volume is now in the public domain.Comparison also has been made against the parsing information cited in Wesley J. Perschbacher "The New Analytical Greek Lexicon" (Peabody MA: Hendrickson 1990). The Perschbacher volume is itself an updated and corrected revision of the original Davidson "Analytical Greek Lexicon".Note that more than 500 parsing or other errors which occurred in Davidson and remained uncorrected in the Perschbacher revision have been corrected within the present Online Bible parsing data.The abbreviation system herein utilized although developed independently retains features similar but not identical to those found in Timothy and Barbara Friberg "The Analytical Greek New Testament" (Grand Rapids: Baker 1981) and can be used with ease by anyone familiar with either the Davidson Perschbacher or Friberg volumes.Many nonverbal New Testament Greek forms (e.g. nouns adjectives conjunctions prepositions and particles) can be declined in more than one manner. Following the example of Davidson and Perschbacher the declensions given reflect only those forms which actually occur in the Greek New Testament.The present parsing list makes no claim to be errorfree; should the user discover any errors in either the parsing/declension codes or Strong's numbers while using the Online Bible please inform the present editor c/o SEBTS P.

The Online Bible search routine allows casesensitive searching so that one can easily use lower case to search for Greek words only (with or without wildcards) and upper case to search by parsing or declension only (also with or without wildcards). Using Boolean search capabilities one can combine lower and upper case search requests to select specific Greek forms in association with specified parsing or declension information.Note that in order to search across hyphenated sections of the declension parsing (e.g. for NGSM) one must make a "phrase > search" request since the Online Bible disregards hyphens in its > search routine. Thus to search for NGSM the request must be specific for either the phrase "N GSM" or "NGSM".Note that even though one could search for all the forms of "logov" by "log*" or for all Genitive plural nouns by typing "GPM | GPM | GPN" in order to link a word directly with its own particular declension a fully inclusive PHRASE SEARCH must be requested which includes the preliminary partofspeech identifier (N A or V) when appropriate. E.g. to search for all genitive plural forms of "logov" one must enter a phrase search request for either "log* NGPM | log* NGPF | log* NGPN" or "log* NGP*"Note that the Strong's numbers may also be judiciously utilized when making search requests to reduce the amount of time and space needed to otherwise frame such a request. E.g. one equally could do a phrase search for all genitive plural forms of "logov" by "3056 & NGPM | NGPF | NGPN" or "3056 & NGP*".To search for phrases based solely on grammatical analysis (e.g. for all prepositional phrases followed by an articular neuter genitive noun) one must use the wildcard (*) symbol before each requested parsing in a phrase search request (e.g. "* PREP * > TGSN * NGSN").STRONG'S NUMBERS: For access to the lexical definitions of the root form of each Greek word the appropriate Strong's concordance number has been added immediately following each Greek word. The definition of that word can then be ascertained by following the normal Online Bible F4 key or definition function as found in Englishlanguage based texts.The user should be cautioned however that the Strong's numbers utilized for the Greek New Testament are NOT always identical with those used in coding the English version text. The reason for this discrepancy is simple: James Strong was attempting to help out the lay reader of the Authorized Version in assigning numbers to each unique word root form. For some reason he then decided that the user might be additionally aided if certain words (e.g. the verb "to be" or comparative and superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs) were further subdivided into uniquelynumbered forms; or conversely if frequent expressions comprising more than one word (e.g. "ou mh") were subsumed under > a single number rather than giving the usual separate numbers to such forms.Thus the Strong's apparatus wellsuited as it may be for use of the concordance he produced as well as to aid the English reader who does not know Greek is quite confusing and detrimental to the student who might seek to use the same numbers for understanding the root forms of the Greek New Testament.In order to eliminate the various problems which would otherwise arise from an incautious use of Strong's numbers as originally provided for the English Bible the present Greek edition of the Online Bible has reduced the Strong's numbers considerably so as to guide the user directly to the root form of most Greek wordswithout adding in the extra step of having further to enquire via the lexicon as to the component or root forms of such words.This revision of the Strong's numbers for the Greek text of the New Testament is not yet complete. Future editions of the Online Bible Greek text will eventually bring all Strong's numbers into conformity with the principle of providing only the base root form for all Greek New Testament words. The user's patience is requested during this period of development.ADDITIONAL NOTES:Declined proper nouns are not specifically identified as such; only indeclinable forms are so identified.It is ASSUMED that all Strong's numbers are correct; these have not all been verified except in a few cases where errors were corrected during the process.Reflexive pronouns have the Person (123) attached e.g. F3DSF See "auth" in Perschbacher for further examples."rmd" is the abbreviated numeral for 144000.

Thus to search for VPAI3S the request must be specific for either the phrase "V PAI 3S" or "VPAI3S".Note that even though one could search for all the forms of "legw" by "leg* | eleg*" or for all Present Active Indicative forms by "PAI" in order to link a word directly with its own particular parsing a fully inclusive PHRASE SEARCH must be requested which indicates the preliminary partofspeech identifier (V N or A) when appropriate. E.g. to search for > all the Present Active Indicative forms of "legw" one would have to request a phrase search for search for "leg* VPAI".Note that the Strong's numbers may also be judiciously utilized when making search requests to reduce the amount of time and space needed to otherwise frame such a request. E.g. one equally could do a phrase search for all Present Indicative Active forms of "legw" by "3004 VPAI"To search for phrases based solely on grammatical analysis (e.g. for all prepositional phrases followed by an articular neuter genitive noun) one must use the wildcard (*) symbol before each requested parsing in a phrase search request (e.g. "* PREP * TGSN * NGSN").Special note: the so called "Second" forms of the Aorist Future Perfect and Pluperfect are respectively designated as 2A 2F 2P and 2L preceding the voice and mood designations. Functionally however these forms are equivalent to the otherwise undesignated (First) Aorist Future Perfect and Pluperfect forms.Search requests which expect to take in BOTH the first and second forms of either the Aorist Future Perfect or Pluperfect tenses MUST be prefixed with an asterisk (*). Failure to use the wildcard prefix will result in the second tense forms NOT being found.Example: to search for all Perfect Active Indicative forms (i.e. both RAI and 2RAI) the wildcard form *RAI should be used. Similarly to search for all Aorist Active Subjunctive forms (i.e. AAS and 2AAS) the wildcard form *AAS should be used.STRONG'S NUMBERS:For access to the lexical definitions of the root form of each Greek word the appropriate Strong's concordance number has been added immediately following each Greek word.

The user's patience is requested during this period of development.ADDITIONAL NOTE REGARDING THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE VERB "TO BE"Strong's Concordance at times gives separate numbers to various forms of the verb "to be". All of these properly derive from "eimi" (1510) alone. Perschbacher gives both numbers: the separate Strong's number in the left margin and the root number in the right margin. For the present time the Online Bible has retained Strong's number in these cases even though Strong's own lexicon entry indicates the proper derivation from the root form 1510.Since accents and breathings are not provided within the Online Bible Greek text some forms will appear identical even though they possess different parsings or declensions. Within the forms of the verb "to be" the following cases specifically should be noted: The verb form "h" (3spxs of 1510 numbered 2229 by Strong) occurs infrequently while the definite article relative pronoun and disjunctive particle forms of "h" dominate within the Greek NT. The verb form "ei" (2spxi of 1510) also occurs (in the absence of > accents and breathings) as a conditional particle in fact most frequently so. The verb form "hn" (3sixi of 1510) occurs also as a relative pronoun. However the verb form is dominant within the Greek NT. The verb form "wsin" is not from 5607 (participle) but is a subjunctive of (1510). Note also that "wsin" may be a plural noun form of 3775. Of particular note: the verb form "hv" stems from 1510 if it is a > present subjunctive but from 2229 if it is an imperfect indicative.SAMPLE OF CURRENT CODING AS APPLIED:Perschbacher:agayopoihsai (15) aor. act. inf.agayopoihte (15) 2 pers. pl. pres. act. subj.agayopoiountav (17) acc. pl. m. pres. act. part.Online Bible:AAN <15>2PPAS <15>APMPAP <17>Top of PageSeptember 13 2004 David Symcox found a 53digit factor for M971.

An integer greater than one is called a prime number if its only divisors are one and itself. The first prime numbers are 2 3 5 7 11 etc. For example the number 10 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 5. A Mersenne prime is a prime of the form 2P1. The first Mersenne primes are 3 7 31 127 etc. There are only 41 known Mersenne primes.GIMPS the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search was formed in January 1996 to discover new worldrecordsize Mersenne primes. GIMPS harnesses the power of thousands of small computers like yours to search for these "needles in a haystack".Most GIMPS members join the search for the thrill of possibly discovering a recordsetting rare and historic new Mersenne prime.

There are thousands of free applets available on the internet for almost any purpose. Most of them can be customized without programming.Most of today's browsers can run applets. The ones that can't aren't of much importance since very few users have such outdated browsers. To be more precise applets can be embedded in pages viewed by Netscape 2+ and Internet Explorer 3+.However some people have turned off the ability to run applets in their browser. This is in most cases companies with more or less paranoid ideas of potential hacking.No matter what their motivation is it's a fact that there are a minor amount of people out there that will not see your applets even if their browser is capable of showing it. This should be taken into consideration before deciding to add applets to your pages.An applet can be embedded into a webpage. Usually the applet has several settings that will allow you to personalize it. For instance if you insert an applet that will work as a menu you can specify which options should be in the menu and which pages should be loaded upon click on an option.Since Java is a real programming language there aren't many limitations to it. Any program running on your computer could possibly have been made as an applet. Spreadsheets wordprocessors graphics programs... even entire browsers could be made with Java. However most applets used on webpages serve much smaller purposes than the ones mentioned. The reason is simple: They need to be transferred through the internet and therefore can't take up just any amount of space.Cyborg Babies and CyDoughPlasmIdeas about Self and Life in theCulture of Simulation The genius of Jean Piaget (1960) showed us the degree to which it is the business of childhood to take the objects in the world and use how they "work" to construct theories of space time number causality life and mind. Fifty years ago when Piaget was formulating his theories a child's world was full of things that could be understood in simple mechanical ways. A bicycle could be understood in terms of its pedals and gears a windup car in terms of its clockwork springs. Children were able to take electronic devices such as basic radios and (with some difficulty) bring them into this "mechanical" system of understanding. Since the end of the 1970s however with the introduction of electronic toys and games the nature of objects and how children understand them have changed. When children today remove the back of their computer toys to "see" how they work they find a chip a battery and some wires. Sensing that trying to understand these objects "physically" will lead to a dead end children try to use a "psychological" kind of understanding (Turkle 1984:2963). Children ask themselves if the games are conscious if the games know if they have feelings and even if they "cheat." Earlier objects encouraged children to think in terms of a distinction between the world of psychology and the world of machines but the computer does not. Its "opacity" encourages children to see computational objects as psychological machines. Over the last twenty years I have observed and interviewed hundreds of children as they have interacted with a wide range of computational objects from computer programs on the screen to robots off the screen (Turkle 1984 1995). My methods are ethnographic and clinical. In the late 1970s and early 1980s I began by observing children playing with the first generation of electronic toys and games. In the 1990s I have worked with children using a new generation of computer games and software and experimenting with online life on the Internet. Among the first generation of computational objects was Merlin which challenged children to games of tictactoe. For children who had only played games with human opponents reaction to this object was intense. For example while Merlin followed an optimal strategy for winning tictactoe most of the time it was programmed to make a slip every once in a while. So when children discovered a strategy that would sometimes allow them to win and then tried it again it usually didn't work. The machine gave the impression of not being "dumb enough" to let down its defenses twice. Robert seven playing with his friends on the beach watched his friend Craig perform the "winning trick" but when he tried it Merlin did not make its slip and the game ended in a draw. Robert confused and frustrated accused Merlin of being a cheating machine." Children were used to machines being predictable. But this machine surprised. Robert threw Merlin into the sand in anger and frustration. "Cheater. I hope your brains break." He was overheard by Craig and Greg aged six and eight who salvaged the bynowverysandy toy and took it upon themselves to set Robert straight. Craig offered the opinion that "Merlin doesn't know if it cheats. It won't know if it breaks. It doesn't know if you break it Robert. It's not alive." Greg adds: "It's smart enough to make the right kinds of noises. But it doesn't really know if it loses. That's how you can cheat it. It doesn't know you are cheating. And when it cheats it doesn't even know it's cheating." Jenny six interrupted with disdain: "Greg to cheat you have to know you are cheating. Knowing is part of cheating. In the early 1980s such scenes were not unusual. Confronted with objects that spoke strategized and "won" children were led to argue the moral and metaphysical status of machines on the basis of their psychologies: Did the machines know what they were doing? Did they have intentions consciousness and feelings? These first computers that entered children's lives were evocative objects: they became the occasion for new formulations about the human and the mechanical. For despite Jenny's objections that "knowing is part of cheating" children did come to see computational objects as exhibiting a kind of knowing. She was part of a first generation of children who were willing to invest machines with qualities of consciousness as they rethought the question of what is alive in the context of "machines that think." In the past twenty years the objects of children's lives have come to include machines of even greater intelligence toys and games and programs that make these first cybertoys seem primitive in their ambitions. The answers to the classical Piagetian question of how children think about life are being renegotiated as they are posed in the context of computational objects that explicitly present themselves as exemplars of "artificial life." 1. FROM PHYSICS TO PSYCHOLOGY Piaget studying children in the world of "traditional" that is noncomputational objects found that as children matured they homed in on a definition of life which centered around "moving of one's own accord." First everything that moved was taken to be alive then only things that moved without an outside push or pull. Gradually children refined the notion of "moving of one's own accord" to mean the "life motions" of breathing and metabolism. This meant that only those things that breathed and grew were taken to be alive. But from the first generation of children who met computers and electronic toys and games (the children of the late 1970s and early 1980s) there was a disruption in this classical story. Whether or not children thought their computers were alive they were sure that how the toys moved was not at the heart of the matter. Children's discussions about the computer's aliveness came to center on what the children perceived as the computer's psychological rather than physical properties. To put it too simply motion gave way to emotion and physics gave way to psychology as criteria for aliveness. Today only a decade later children have learned to say that their computers are "just machines" but they continue to attribute psychological properties to them. The computational objects are said to have qualities (such as having intentions and ideas) that were previously reserved for people. Thus today's children seem comfortable with a reconstruction of the notion of a machine" which includes having a psychology. And children often use the phrase "sort of alive" to describe the computer's nature. An elevenyearold named Holly watches a group of robots navigate a maze. The robots use different strategies to reach their goal and Holly is moved to comment on their "personalities" and their "cuteness." She finally comes to speculate on the robots' "aliveness" and blurts out an unexpected formulation: "It's like Pinocchio."	First Pinocchio was just a puppet. He was not alive at all. Then he was an alive puppet. Then he was an alive boy. A real boy. But he was alive even before he was a real boy. So I think the robots are like that. They are alive like Pinocchio [the puppet] but not "real boys."	She sums up her thought: "They [the robots] are sort of alive." In September 1987 more than one hundred scientists and technical researchers gathered together in Los Alamos New Mexico to found a discipline devoted to working on machines that might cross the boundary between "sort of" to "really" alive. They called their new enterprise "artificial life." From the outset many of artificial life's pioneers developed their ideas by writing programs on their personal computers. These programs easily shipped off on floppy disks or shared via the Internet have revolutionized the social diffusion of ideas. Christopher Langton (1989:13) one of the founders of the discipline of artificial life argued that biological evolution relies on unanticipated bottomup effects: simple rules interacting to give rise to complex behavior. He further argued that artificial life would only be successful if it shared this aesthetic of "emergent effects" with nature. The cornerstone idea of decentralized bottomup emergence is well illustrated by a program written in the mid1980s known as "boids." Its author the computer animator Craig Reynolds wanted to explore whether flocking behavior whether in fish birds or insects might happen without a flock leader or the intention to flock. Reynolds wrote a computer program that caused virtual birds to flock in which each "bird" acted "solely on the basis of its local perception of the world" (1987:27). Reynolds called the digital birds "boids" an extension of hightech jargon that refers to generalized objects by adding the suffix "oid." A boid could be any flocking creature. Each "boid" was given three simple rules: (1) if you are too close to a neighboring boid move away from it; (2) if not as fast as your neighboring boid speed up; if not as slow as your neighboring boid slow down; (3) if you are moving toward the greater density of boids maintain direction; if not do so. The rules working together created flocks of boids that could fly around obstacles and change direction. The boids program posed the evocative question: How could it be established that the behavior produced by the boids (behavior to which it was easy to attribute intentionality and leadership) was different from behavior in the natural world? Were animals following simple rules that led to their complex "lifelike" behavior. Were people following simple rules that led to their complex "lifelike" behavior? In writing about the dissemination of ideas about microbes and the bacteria] theory of disease in latenineteenthcentury France the sociologist of science Bruno Latour (1988) argued that the message of Louis Pasteur's writings was less significant than the social deployment of an army of "hygienists" state employees who visited every French farm to spread the word. The hygienists were the "foot soldiers" of Pasteur's revolution. In the case of artificial life the foot soldiers are "shippable" products in the form of computer programs commercial computer games and small robots some of which are sold as toys. I do not argue that these products are artificial life but that they are significant actors for provoking a new discourse about aliveness. Electronic toys and games introduced psychology into children's categories for talking about the "quality of life"; a new generation of computational objects is introducing ideas about decentralization and emergence. 2. "ALIVE" ON THE SCREEN In the mid1980s the biologist Thomas Ray set out to create a computer world in which selfreplicating digital creatures could evolve by themselves. Ray imagined that the motor for the evolution of the artificial organisms would be their competition for CPU (central processing unit) time. The less CPU time that a digital organism needed to replicate the more "fit" it would be in its "natural" computer environment. Ray called his system Tierra the Spanish word for "Earth." In January 1990 Ray wrote the computer program for his first digital creature. It consisted of eighty instructions. It evolved progeny which could replicate with even fewer instructions. This meant that these progeny were "fitter" than their ancestor because they could compete better in an environment where computer memory was scarce. Further evolution produced ever smaller selfreplicating creatures digital "parasites" that passed on their genetic material by latching onto larger digital organisms. When some host organisms developed immunity to the first generation of parasites new kinds of parasites were born. For Ray a system that selfreplicates and is capable of openended evolution is alive. From this point of view Rav believed that Tierra running on his Toshiba laptop computer was indeed alive. Ray made Tierra available on the Internet ready for "downloading" via modem. And it was downloaded all over the world often to school science clubs and biology classes. A fifteenyearold high school student said that working with Tierra made him feel as though he were "looking at cells through an electron microscope. I know that it is all happening in the computer but I have to keep reminding myself." Tierra was an objecttothinkwith for considering selfreplication and evolution as essential to life. "You set it up and you let it go. And a whole world starts" said the student. "I have to keep reminding myself that it isn't going to jump out of the machine. . . . I dreamt that I would find little animals in there. Two times I ran it at night but it's not such a great idea because I couldn't really sleep." Ray could not predict the developments that would take place in his system. He too stayed up all night watching new processes evolve. The lifelike behavior of his digital Tierrans emerged from the "bottom up." At MIT's Media Laboratory the computer scientist and educational researcher Mitchel Resnick worked to bring the artificial life aesthetic into the world of children. He began by giving them a robot construction kit that included sensors and motors as well as standard Lego blocks. Children quickly attributed lifelike properties to their creations. Children experienced one little robot as "confused" because it moved back and forth between two points (because of rules that both told it to seek out objects and to move away quickly if it sensed an object). Children classified other robots as nervous frightened and sad. The first LegoLogo robots were tethered by cables to a "mother" computer but eventually researchers were able to give the robots an "onboard" computer. The resulting autonomy made the LegoLogo creations seem far less like machines and far more like creatures. For the children who worked with them this autonomy further suggested that machines might be creatures and creatures might be machines. Resnick also developed programming languages among these a language he called StarLogo that would enable children to control the parallel actions of many hundreds of "creatures" on a computer screen. Traditional computer programs follow one instruction at a time; with Resnick's StarLogo program multiple instructions were followed at the same time simulating the way things occur in nature. And as in nature simple rules led to complex behaviors. For example a population of screen "termites" in an environment of digital "wood chips" were given a set of two rules: if you're not carrying anything and you bump into a wood chip pick it up; if you're carrying a wood chip and you bump into another wood chip put down the chip you're carrying. Imposing these two rules at the same time will cause the screen termites to make wood chip piles (Resnick 1992:76). So children were able to get the termites to stockpile woodchips without ever giving the termites a command to do so. Similarly children could use StarLogo to model birds in a flock ants in a colony cars in a traffic jam all situations in which complex behavior emerges from the interaction of simple rules. Children who worked with these materials struggled to describe the quality of emergence that their objects carried. "In this version of Logo" said one "you can get more [out of the program] than what you tell it to do" (Resnick 1992:131132). An object such as StarLogo opens up more than new technical possibilities: it gives children concrete material for thinking in what Resnick has termed a "decentralized mindset." The key principle here is selforganization complexity results although there is no topdown intervention or control. In a centralized model of evolution God designs the process sets it in motion and keeps close tabs to make sure it conforms to design. In a decentralized model God can be there but in the details: simple rules whose interactions result in the complexity of nature. StarLogo teaches how decentralized rules can be the foundation for behavior that may appear to be "intentional" or a result of "following the leader." It also provides a window onto resistance to decentralized thinking. When confronted with the wood chip piles Resnick reports that most adults prefer to assume that a leader stepped in to direct the process or that there was an asymmetry in the world that gave rise to a pattern for example a food source near the final location of a stockpile (Resnick Turtles Termites and Traffic Jams: 137ff). In reflecting on this resistance to ideas about decentralization Resnick (1992:122) cites the historian of science Evelyn Fox Keller who in reviewing the history of resistance to decentralized ideas in biology was led to comment: "We risk imposing on nature the very stories we like to hear." Why do we like to hear centralized stories? There is our Western monotheistic tradition; there is our experience over millennia of largescale societies governed by centralized authority and controlled through centralized bureaucracy; there is our experience of ourselves as unitary and intentional actors (the ego as "I"); and there is also the fact that we have traditionally lacked concrete objects in the world with which to think about decentralization. Objects such as StarLogo present themselves as objects to think with for thinking about emergent phenomena and decentralized control. As a wider range of such objects enter our culture the balance between our tendency to assume decentralized emergence or centralized command may change. The children who tinkered with parallel computation became comfortable with the idea of multiple processes and decentralized methods. Indeed they came to enjoy this "quality of emergence" and began to associate it with the quality of aliveness. The idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts has always been resonant with religious and spiritual meaning. Decentered emergent phenomena combine a feeling that one knows the rules with the knowledge that one cannot predict the outcome. To children emergent phenomena seem almost magical because one can know what every individual object will do but still have no idea of what the system as a whole will look like. This is the feeling that the children were expressing when they described getting "more out" of the StarLogo program than they told it to do. The children know that there are rules behind the magic and that there is magic in the rules. In a cyborg consciousness objects are reenchanted. When children programming in StarLogo got a group of objects on the screen to clump together in predictable groups by commanding them to do so they did not consider this "interesting" in the sense that it did not seem "lifelike." But if they gave the objects simple rules that had no obvious relation to clumping behavior but clumping "happened" all the same that behavior did seem lifelike. So for children working in the StarLogo learning culture "teaching" computer birds to flock by explicitly telling them where to go in every circumstance seemed to be a kind of "cheating." They were developing an "ethic of simulation" in which decentralization and emergence became requirements for things to seem "alive enough" to be interesting. In this example computational media show their potential to generate new ways of thinking. Just as children exposed to electronic toys and games begin to think differently about the definition of aliveness (thinking in terms of psychology rather than physical motion) so children exposed to parallel processing begin to think about life in terms of emergent phenomena. 3. THE "SIMS" The authors of the "Sim" series of computer games (among these SimAnt SimCity SimHealth SimLife) write explicitly of their effort to use the games to communicate ideas about artificial life (Bremer 1991:163). For example in the most basic game of SimAnt (played on one "patch" of a simulated backyard) a player learns about local bottomup determination of behavior: each ant's behavior is determined by its own state its assay of its direct neighbors and a set of rules. Like Reynolds's "boids" and the objects in StarLogo the ants change their state in reference to who they are and with whom they are in contact. SimAnt players learn about pheromones the virtual tracer chemicals by which ants as well as Resnick's StarLogo objects "communicate" with one another. Beyond this SimAnt players learn how in certain circumstances local actions that seem benign (mating a few ants) can lead to disastrous global results (population overcrowding and death). Children playing Sim games make a connection between the individual games and some larger set of ideas. Tim a thirteenyearold player says of SimLife: "You get to mutate plants and animals into different species . . . . You are part of something important. You are part of artificial life." As for the Sim creatures themselves Tim thinks that the "animals that grow in the computer could be alive" although he adds "This is kind of spooky." Laurence a more blase fifteenyearold doesn't think the idea of life on the screen is spooky at all. "The whole point of this game" he tells me	is to show that you could get things that are alive in the computer. We get energy from the sun. The organisms in a computer get energy from the plug in the wall. I know that more people will agree with me when they make a SimLife where the creatures are smart enough to communicate. You are not going to feel comfortable if a creature that can talk to you goes extinct.	 Robbie a tenyearold who has been given a modem for her birthday uses her experience of the game to develop some insight into those computer processes that led adults to use the term "virus" for programs that "traveled." She puts the emphasis on mobility instead of communication when she considers whether the creatures she has evolved on SimLife are alive.	I think they are a little alive in the game but you can turn it off and you cannot "save" your game so that all the creatures you have evolved go away. But if they could figure out how to get rid of that part of the program so that you would have to save the game and if your modem were on then they could get out of your computer and go to America Online.	Sean thirteen who has never used a modem comes tip with a variant on Robbie's ideas about SimLife creatures and their Internet travel: "The [Sim] creatures could be more alive if they could get into DOS." In Piaget's classical studies of the 1920s on how children thought about what was alive the central variable was motion. Simply put children took up the question of an object's "life status" by asking themselves if the object could move of its own accord. When in the late 1970s and early 1980s I studied children's reactions to a first generation of computer objects which were physically "stationary" but which nonetheless accomplished impressive feats of cognition (talking spelling doing math and playing tictactoe) I found that the focus had shifted to an object's psychological properties when children considered the question of its "aliveness." Now in children's comments about the creatures that exist on simulation games the emphasis is on evolution. But this emphasis also includes a recapitulation of criteria that draw from physics and psychology. Children talk about digital "travel" via circulating disks or over modems. They talk of viruses and networks. In this language biology and motion are resurfacing in a new guise now bound up in the ideas of communication and evolution. Significantly the resurfacing of motion (Piaget's classical criterion) is bound up with notions of presumed psychology: children were most likely to assume that the creatures on Sim games have a desire to "get out" of the system and evolve in a wider computational world. 4. "CYCLING THROUGH" Although the presence of computational objects disrupted the classical Piagetian story for talking about aliveness the story children were telling about computational objects in the early 1980s had its own coherency. Faced with intelligent toys children took a new world of objects and imposed a new world order based not on physics but on psychology. In the 1990s that order has been strained to the breaking point. Children will now talk about computers as "just machines" but describe them as sentient and intentional. Faced with evermorecomplex computational objects children are now in the position of theoretical bricoleurs or tinkerers "making do" with whatever materials are at hand "making do" with whatever theory can fit a prevailing circumstance. They cycle through evolution and psychology and resurface ideas about motion in terms of the communication of bits. My current collection of comments about life by children who have played with small mobile robots the games of the "Sim" series and Tierra includes the following notions: the robots are in control but not alive would be alive if they had bodies are alive because they have bodies would be alive if they had feelings are alive the way insects are alive but not the way people are alive; the Tierrans are not alive because they are just in the computer could be alive if they got out of the computer are alive until you turn off the computer and then they're dead are not alive because nothing in the computer is real; the Sim creatures are not alive but almostalive they would be alive if they spoke they would be alive if they traveled they're alive but not real" they're not alive because they don't have bodies they are alive because they can have babies and finally for an elevenyearold who is relatively new to SimLife they're not alive because these babies don't have parents. She says: "They show the creatures and the game tells you that they have mothers and fathers but I don't believe it. It's just numbers it's not really a mother and a father." There is a striking heterogeneity of theory here. Different children hold different theories and individual children are able to hold different theories at the same time. The heterogeneity of children's views is apparent when they talk about something as "big" as the life of a computational creature and about something as "small" as why a robot programmed with "emergent" methods might move in a certain way. One fifthgrader named Sara jumped back and forth from a psychological to a mechanical language when she talked about the LegoLogo creature she had built. When Sara considered whether her machine would sound a signal when its "touch sensor" was pushed she said: "It depends on whether the machine wants to tell . . . if we want the machine to tell us . . . if we tell the machine to tell us" (Resnick 1989:402). In other words within a few seconds Sara "cycled through" three perspectives on her creature (as psychological being as intentional self as instrument of its programmer's intentions). The speed of her alternations suggests that these perspectives are equally present for her at all times. For some purposes she finds one or another of them more useful. In the short history of how the computer has changed the way we think it has often been children who have led the way. For example in the early 1980s children prompted by computer toys that spoke did math and played tictactoe disassociated ideas about consciousness from ideas about life something that historically had not been the case. These children were able to contemplate sentient computers that were not alive a position that grownups are only now beginning to find comfortable. Today's cyborg children are taking things even further; they are pointing the way toward a radical heterogeneity of theory in the presence of computational artifacts that evoke "life." In his history of artificial life Steven Levy (1992:67) suggested that one way to look at where artificial life can "fit in" to our way of thinking about life is to envisage a continuum in which Tierra for example would be more alive than a car but less alive than a bacterium. My observations suggest that children are not constructing hierarchies but are heading toward parallel alternating definitions. The development of heterogeneity in children's theories is of course taking place in a larger context. We are all living in the presence of computational objects that carry emergent decentralized theories and encourage a view of the self as fluid and multiple. Writers from many different disciplinary perspectives are arguing for a multiple and fluid notion of the self. Daniel C. Dennett (1991) argues for a "multiple drafts" theory of consciousness. The presence of the drafts encourages a respect for the many different versions and it imposes a certain distance from being identified with any one of them. No one aspect of self can be claimed as the absolute true self. Robert Jay Lifton (1993) views the contemporary self as "protean" multiple yet integrated allowing for a "sense of self" without being one self. Donna Haraway equates a "split and contradictory self" with a "knowing self": "The knowing self is partial in all its guises never finished whole simply there and original; it is always constructed and stitched together imperfectly; and therefore able to join with another to see together without claiming to be another" (1991a:22). In computational environments such ideas about identity and multiplicity are "brought down to earth" and enter children's lives from their earliest days. Even the operating system on the computers they use to play games to draw and to write carries the message. A computer's "windows" have become a potent metaphor for thinking about the self as a multiple and distributed system (Turkle 1995). Hypertext links have become a metaphor for a multiplicity of perspectives. On the Internet people who participate in virtual communities may be "logged on" to several of them (open as several openscreen windows) as they pursue other activities. In this way they may come to experience their lives as a "cycling through" screen worlds in which they may be expressing different aspects of self. But such mediaborne messages about multiple selves and theories are controversial. Today's adults grew up in a psychological culture that equated the idea of a unitary self with psychological health and in a scientific culture that taught that when a discipline achieves maturity it has a unifying theory. When adults find themselves cycling through varying perspectives on themselves ("I am my chemicals" to "I am my history" to "I am my genes") they usually become uncomfortable (Kramer 1993: xiixiii). But such alternations may strike the generation of cyborg children who are growing up today as "just the way things are." Children speak easily about factors which encourage them to see the stuff" of computers as the same "stuff" of which life is made. Among these are the ideas of "shape shifting" and "morphing." Shape shifting is tile technique used by the evil android in Terminator II to turn into the form of anything he touched including people. A nineyearold showed an alchemist's sensibility when lie explained how this occurs: "It is very simple. In the universe anything can turn to anything else when you have the right formula. So you can be a person one minute and a machine the next minute." Morphing is a general term that covers form changes which may include changes across the animate/inanimate barrier. A tenyearold boy had a lot to say about morphing all of it associated with the lifestyle of "The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" a group of action heroes who turn from teenagers to androidal/ mechanical "dinozords" and "megazords" and back. "Well" he patiently explains "the dinozords are alive; the Power Rangers are alive but not all the parts of the dinozords are alive but all the parts of the Power Rangers are alive. The Power Rangers become the dinozords." Then of course there are seemingly omnipresent "transformer toys" which shift from being machines to being robots to being animals (and sometimes people). Children play with these plastic and metal objects and in the process they learn about the fluid boundaries between mechanism and flesh. I observe a group of sevenyearolds playing with a set of plastic transformer toys that can take the shape of armored tanks robots or people. The transformers can also be put into intermediate states so that a robot arm can protrude from a human form or a human leg from a mechanical tank. Two of the children are playing with the toys in these intermediate states (that is in their intermediate states somewhere between being people machines and robots). A third child insists that this is not right. The toys he says should not be placed in hybrid states. "You should play them as all tank or all people." He is getting upset because the other two children are making a point of ignoring him. An eightyearold girl comforts the upset child. "It's okay to play them when they are in between. It's all the same stuff" she says "just yucky computer cydoughplasm." This comment is the expression of the cyborg consciousness that characterizes today's children: a tendency to see computer systems as "sort of" alive to fluidly "cycle through" various explanatory concepts and to willingly transgress boundaries. Walt Whitman wrote: "A child went forth every day. And the first object he look'd upon that object he became." When Piaget elaborated how the objects in children's lives constructed their psyches he imagined a timeless universal process. With the radical change in the nature of objects the internalized lessons of the object world have changed. When today's adults "cycle through" different theories they are uncomfortable. Such movement does not correspond to the unitary visions they were brought up to expect. But children have learned a different lesson from their cyborg objects. Donna Haraway characterizes irony as being "about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes . . . about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true" (1991b:148). In this sense today's cyborg children growing up into irony are becoming adept at holding incompatible things together. They are cycling through the cydoughplasm into fluid and emergent conceptions of self and life. ReferencesBremer Michael. 1991. SimAnt User Manual. Orinda Calif.Dennett Daniel C. 1991.

There were more holes in it than a gopher ranch.There are a lot of green thumbs in this town when it comes to field management and that's for sure.The look of nearperfection is always a staple of the Clinton High School Baseball Field. Sometimes it's worth the price of admission alone.Coaches Kelly Gaunt and Jeff King have the field looking nice and it's always one of the best in the state. The rain has helped out and there's a reason why the field has won as many awards as it has in the past.Then there's the CHS Softball Field. What a metamorphosis this place has made.A lot of work and care have been put into this facility and it looks different from the chainlink dugouts and open bleachers of before.It looks first rate and would be a perfect place to hold tournaments every year.And the beautiful fields are not limited to the high school facilities. If you want to look at one goodlooking field then check out the Noon Lions Ballpark.David Moore and others have taken the field on as a personal project and it looks great.It really adds to the atmosphere when you take in a teeball game.One other point when you go to any game around town then be sure to frequent the concession stand.The proceeds usually go to the program itself and remember you can never get enough water on a hot sunny day.Even if you are one of those people who feel paying a buck for bottled water is highway robbery remember it's for a good cause.Peewees defeat Sentinel Sean Stephens 4:02 pm PSTThe Clinton Maroon Peewees pulled in a 138 win against Sentinel Monday at home.Only three hits were needed by the Clinton team as walks provided the bulk of the runs on the day.Korbett Moore and Garrett Browning both had a hit and Garrison Mendoza picked up a double.Browning was also the winning pitcher as he threw for five innings walked nine and struck out 10 batters."A lot of kids really looked better and have started to show some improvement" said Coach Jim Bob Browning. "Sentinel had a hard time throwing strikes."The next game for the Maroon Peewees will be Monday at home against Elk City Brown.Saturday May 25 2002Lady Reds to host two camps at Dome Sean Stephens 1:44 pm PSTThis summer the Tornado Dome will be the site of two camps hosted by the Lady Reds as younger athletes get a chance to sharpen their skills and there's even airconditioning this time around.The first will be the Clinton Volleyball Camp and it will be held next week Tuesday through Thursday.The camp will be held from 8:3011:30 a.m. in the Dome and the cost is 20 per camper.

They might think not that many guys could have possibly had that much success.When you add it up chances are that they actually did.Think about it. Eleven state championships with an average of 40 players on a team. That adds up toapproximately 440 players with rings.Freshmen were thrown in the mix some 25 years ago and that runs the total up.Then when you add in the state runnerup squads the numbers would show that approximately 800 players out of 2000 over the last 50 years suited up for a state championship game.Unbelievable.Since 1950 40 percent of the Red Tornadoes who put on a helmet experienced playing for the gold ball. Ada is probably the only bunch who can match that.The Red Tornadoes were an integrated team early. Frederick Hobart and Clinton were the first communities to integrate AfricanAmericans and whites in the '50s.A lot of schools didn’t get around to this until much later for whatever reason.As a result in the '60s Clinton established itself as a multicultural community.There were bumps along the way but the bottom line was we had a leg up on learning how to get along and be successful with a cultural mix.Several coaches 30 years ago credited the Red Tornado football success of four state championships in the '60s to a harmonious mix of AfricanAmerican Native American and white athletes.These coaches were probably right. You might have heard some of our neighboring communities over the years complain about our talent level. It could be they are a little envious that we made everything work.Clinton's cultural mix is certainly not limited to AfricanAmericans Native Americans and whites.Our Hispanic population has grown dramatically over the last 25 years. All of this came together to make Clinton a multicultural “model” for all to see and applaud.“Remember the Titans” was a successful movie starring Denzel Washington.It was about two high schools in Virginia one all AfricanAmerican and one all white both with very successful football programs. The schools were ordered to integrate. I think it was set in the early '70s.The movie pointed out the problems experienced in getting the two cultures together. They are successful in the mix and win a state championship.It is fitting that everyone “Remembers the Titans.”This just in — the Titans have nothing on the Red Tornadoes.We’ve had several races colors and creeds running together over the years. It took good people to make things work and they did.There are a lot of those good folks in town this weekend. One could say they made history with all their success on the field.One could also say they made history another way. Over the years the athletes have blended together to make us the multicultural community we are today. They led the way for the rest of us.Dizzy Dean said “If you done it it ain’t braggin'.” These guys in town this weekend have done it even more so than the “Titans.”Weather doesn't take out tourney Sean Stephens 1:41 pm PSTAs nasty as the weather became this weekend there was still room for a good time at the Riverside Golf Course as it played host to the Sixth Annual Continue the Tradition Golf Tournament.A modest turnout braved the rain and the north wind for a little camaraderie and a good time with fellow alumni.Proceeds raised from the event will go to benefit the CHS football program this season.Riverside to host junior golf Sean Stephens 1:40 pm PSTRiverside to host junior golfThe Riverside Golf Course has plans to host another Junior Golf Program this year to help reach out to young kids.The signup date for registration is 5 p.m. Friday and the cost is 60 for the summer. It's open for kids age 7 to 12.The group will meet Wednesdays from June 12 through July 31.Clubs will be provided for young golfers who do not have any and there are scholarships available. Each program participant will receive a Tshirt for attending.For more information contact Billy Jennings at Riverside at 3235958.Friday May 24 2002CDN Hustle Award winners selected Sean Stephens 2:47 pm PSTWith school officially at a halt it's time to name this year's crop of recipients of the Clinton Daily News Hustle Award.These are the kids who make sports fun as they have the willingness to put forth the extra effort and know the value of hard work.A representative of the newspaper and the respective coaching staff selects winners. Some of the criteria in regard to selection is to have a good work ethic attend practice regularly keep their grades up have a good attitude and show improvement over the course of the season.Winners will receive a plaque over the course of the summer commemorating their award.Emily GastineauYou can't think softball without thinking about this CHS power hitter. That's why she is the fastpitch and slowpitch recipient this year.Both Coach Kelly Gaunt and Coach Wes Marshall had gaudy numbers produced at the plate from Gastineau and that comes from endless hours of hitting ball after ball.Chad DuffNot many linemen stand fivefoot four inches tall but then again not all linemen could lift the back end of your car.Duff was a force in the trenches and used his strength and will to push around guys a lot bigger than he was. Coach Mike Lee always has a soft spot in his heart for linemen.Shona MunseyCoach Valerie Fariss said volleyball's biggest enthusiast was Munsey. She was always there and when she couldn't be there she practiced on her own.With a camera in hand she was excited to be in the sport and excited to get a chance to play.Darrell ElyIt was fun watching the big guy progress through the years. This basketball season he led the team in almost every scoring category.Coach Mickey Replogle would tell you in a minute about how he wished he wasn't losing this senior. The effort was always there.Sabrina OusleyAll this basketball senior did was come in and learn a new position — the point. Not an easy task but with her natural ability and determination she helped take her team to state.Fariss put a big responsibility on her shoulders and was rewarded with a super effort.Vidal EspinozaHe's part of the youthful excitement in the wrestling program right now. Vidal was one win away from qualifying for the state tournament this season.Coach Steven Cardenas said he's been impressed with his work habits and can tell he's right on the edge. Wait until he's a senior.Bill MandrellLet this be a lesson to younger kids. If you want playing time then shag foul balls wipe down wet baseballs cheer your teammates on and work hard.If Gaunt ever needed pure hustle then Mandrell was the one to call on. He worked himself into the lineup literally.The Aneshansley TwinsNormally this award goes to one person but Coach Phil Veazey had a difficult time trying to distinguish who should get the honor and with good reason.Autumn and Leigh were a dominant doubles team and Veazey said they did everything expected of senior leaders. They functioned as one unit on the court and supported their teammates along the way.Johnny RosalesA welcome surprise to tennis this season was Rosales and the younger classmen as they qualified a full team for state.Veazey said Rosales would wear people out with his practice habits. He was always dragging people out to go play a few sets. He couldn't get enough.Cole HuberWhen the CHS soccer team was eliminated from playoff contention the one who took it the hardest was Huber. You could tell it mattered to him the most.Coach Eugene Jefferson knew he had a leader in Huber and if you throw in his timely assists then you have someone who really cares about the game. Soccer is in his blood. He can't help it.Tabitha CardenasMaybe it goes back to her softball experience but in her second year of soccer you could tell she became a competitor.Jefferson said he was nothing but pleased with the way she worked and led the team. Normally quick with a joke or laugh you could tell she took things seriously.Cooper BarrickYou could almost give this award to the whole golf team considering how they improved through the year.Barrick was the lone entrant to the state tournament and Coach Lee said he was just as good as any for the award. He'll have a chance to come back with his experience. The Red Tornadoes will be back on top again.Lindsay SmithMaking a huge leap in improvement this golf season was Smith. She continually lowered her scores as the Lady Reds surprised several teams.Replogle said he enjoyed the way she stepped her game up this season. As the lone senior it was her job to come up big and she did.Lady Reds to host two camps this summer at Tornado Dome Sean Stephens 2:40 pm PSTThis summer the Tornado Dome will be the site of two camps hosted by the Lady Reds as younger athletes get a chance to sharpen their skills.The first will be the Clinton Volleyball Camp and it will be held next week Tuesday through Thursday.The camp will be held from 8:3011:30 a.m. in the Dome and the cost is 20 per camper.

His older brother John was also an AllState selection in 2000.Boone who earlier in the year signed a scholarship deal with Missouri will play in the AllState Game at 7 p.m. July 20 at Driller Park in Tulsa.Boone's productivity at the plate made him a natural selection for the AllState selection.He led the Reds this season in just about every offensive category as he was at the top of the list for his team in homers triples and other categories.Boone is a bigtime hitter and it was evident when teams would put him on first base without ever throwing him a pitch. He commanded respect from opposing baseball teams.The Clinton shortstop will call two former 4A opponents his teammates in the AllState Game.Matt Yost of Elk City and Anadarko's Eric Dabbs were also selected to the AllState roster.Joining them will be teammates from Yukon Norman North Guthrie Mustang Choctaw Westmoore Purcell Northwest Classen and Edmond Santa Fe. They will be coached by Lonny Cobble of Santa Fe.On the Small West roster several western Oklahoma picks were made.LookebaSickles had two with Landon Scales and Levi Garrett. Leedey also placed two on the list with Matt Stout and Caleb Briggs representing the Bison.Wednesday May 22 2002Aneshansley signs with SWOSU Sean Stephens 3:33 pm PSTFor the second straight year Southwestern has given fans of western Oklahoma basketball a reason to head over to Weatherford.Last year Paige Adams was signed to the women's basketball team and this year Autumn Aneshansley joins the ranks of the Lady Bulldogs.It was Aneshansley's wish to play college basketball and stepping up to make the offer was Southwestern's Shelly Pond.Aneshansley is happy with her decision to play college basketball so close to home and she talked about the advantages of playing at Southwestern."At first I was a little leery because it was so close to home" she said. "As it turns out it's better in the long run. This way my family can come see me play and the crowd can come out and support western Oklahoma."I'm really excited about this opportunity. I've wanted to play college basketball for a long time."Next year she will get her chance as she talked about where Pond said she would likely get playing time."She talked about me playing in the post" Aneshansley said. "I'm excited about playing any position in college. I know I'm going to have to work hard if I'm going to play the post because I'm used to playing the 3 or 4."She said because of my height and the fact that I'm lefthanded that I should be able to give people some trouble and that would work to my advantage."While Aneshansley is six foot there are some redwoods in the paint when it comes to the next level. Big nasty trees with bad dispositions when it comes to their territory.She talked about what she feels she has to do to perform well against the giant trees and how she expects to combat them."This summer I have to work on my strength" she said. "I have to get a lot stronger and more physical. I have to learn to use my body more to hold off the defender."A good old pump fake usually works and if you go up into them then you are likely to draw the foul."Pond knew of Aneshansley's strengths because she once coached against her when she was the Weatherford High School coach.It naturally takes a little bit of getting used to that fact for Aneshansley."It does feel strange because she did coach against us" she said. "I think it's going to work to our advantage. She knows what we do best out here. I'm excited about the opportunity."I like the girls she has brought in this year and we all seemed to get along well together. We did the ropes course at Crowder Lake and that was a lot of fun getting to know each other."More familiarity will be at SWOSU with Adams on the team."We got to play two years together and we know each other's strengths" Aneshansley said. "She could be there for encouragement as well because she is ahead of me by one year."I'm excited about the chance to play with her. It will be fun to play with an old high school teammate again."There were some people Aneshansley wanted to thank for helping her get to where she is today."I want to thank Coach (Bob) Hunter Coach (Valerie) Fariss and Coach (Kelly) Gaunt for all of their tremendous support" she said. "I definitely wouldn't have been able to be where I am if it wasn't for them."I'd like to thank my parents once again for all of their love and support."City offering three programs Sean Stephens 3:30 pm PSTSteve Hewitt parks and recreation director of the City of Clinton announced three programs upcoming programs for people looking to kill some time this summer.Swimming lessons will be offered starting with two sessions starting June 3 for two times a week.The cost is 60 per session and each session runs for one month.
